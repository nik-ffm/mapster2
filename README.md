# tecapp

## Installation
Get docker (boot2docker respectively on mac/windows) & docker-compose, then run ``docker-compose up`` and see magic happen, this will run both a less compiler and a webserver.

Afterwards you can open the app in the browser at port 5005 of your docker machine ip address (for boot2docker usualy 192.168.59.103).
